# Case study 
> WebApi Application

REST API service providing all available products of an eshop and enabling the partial update of one product

## About the application

- This is to demonstrate a chosen multi-layer approach to a backend development of some trivial Eshop providing basic functionality upon products such as:
  - Queries
    - Get product detail (based on filter)
    - Get list of products (based on filter, availability) and its pagination in higher version
  - Commands  
    - Partial update of a product (based on filter and entity state)

- Some other features like logging have also been implemented

## Architecture

### Literature

- ["Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design"](https://books.google.cz/books/about/Clean_Architecture.html?id=8ngAkAEACAAJ) (*Robert C. Martin*)

### Design patterns

- [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) - Command Query Responsibility Segregation (*Martin Fowler*)
- [Mediator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) - A behavioral patter for object interactio that works nicely with [CQRS](https://medium.com/@letienthanh0212/cqrs-and-mediator-in-net-core-project-c0b477eab6e9)

## Tools
